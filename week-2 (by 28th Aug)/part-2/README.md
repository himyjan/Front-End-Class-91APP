# Week 2 Part 2

## Assignment

### Step 1: Visual Details

1. Add `loading animation` for network response waiting, e.g. checkout.
2. Use `regular expression` for input checking, e.g. email and phone number.
3. Add `Hover Effect` for better experience, e.g. category link.
4. Optimize all visual details as possible as you can: font, border, padding, margin, color, size, and any other left behind. (optional)

### Step 2: Refactor Code

Knowing where to refactor within in a system is quite a challenge to identify areas of bad design. These
areas of bad design are known as "Bad Smells" or "Stinks" within code. For examples:

1. Duplicate code
2. Dead Code
3. Long Method
4. Long Parameter List
5. Comments
6. Inappropriate Naming
7. Magic Number
8. Shotgun Surgery
