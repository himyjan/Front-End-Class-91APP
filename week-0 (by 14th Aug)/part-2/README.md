## Assignment

### Step 1: Get Marketing Campaigns

The carousel section is for marketing campaigns, located at the top of the home page. There are many marketing campaigns at the same time, but we just show one at a time.

Connect to [Marketing Campaign API](https://github.com/AppWorks-School-Materials/API-Doc/tree/master/Stylish#marketing-campaigns-api) by AJAX for the links, stories and image paths.

Build the carousel section dynamically.  

If user click on one of them, send user to the corresponding link.

### Step 2: Slide Effect

Complete slide effect to show different campaigns for customers in the carousel section.

1. Change to next slide every 5 seconds automatically.
2. Change to corresponding slide if users click on the dot.
3. Stop the timer when user hovers over the dot.
4. Restart the timer when user's cursor moves out of the dot.
