We notice there is a `paging` feature supported by `Product List API`.  
We can get `paging` data from `Product List API` and set it as parameter of request for next page.

#### Infinite Scroll

If user almost scroll down to the bottom, we should load and show next page automatically. While loading, show a loader at the bottom.
